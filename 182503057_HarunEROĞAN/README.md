# Sign Template is a JavaFX application üîê


 `Status: Complete !!ü¶¶`


This program can be used by any JavaFx programs that require a **Sign up/Sign in** page

<h2> What does the program do? </h2>

This program stores the user's info into a file and it would use it later to check if the user exists (Basically a sign up/sign in page)

<h2>Example of a successful sign up / sign in ‚úÖ</h2>

<h2>A bit more details about this program..üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>

 
As I've mentioned before, once the user **inputs** their information, the application would then **store/write** that information to a file so we could have access to it at any time. Then the next step is **reading** and **writing back** those very pieces of information to a **hashMap**, designed to store the username(**key**) and it's password(**value**), so once a user wants to sign in, we could easily **approve** its username and password. In another word, it would be easy to apply the proper **exceptions** to it. Also when signing up, I've coded some **regex** to make sure the entered values are correct and as the **standards**.
